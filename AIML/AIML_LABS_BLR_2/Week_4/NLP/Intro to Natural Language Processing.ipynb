Since so much of the data we have available is in the form of text, this is extremely important to data science!\n","\n","A specific common application of NLP is each time you use a language conversion tool. The techniques used to accurately convert text from one language to another very much falls under the umbrella of \"natural language processing.\"\n","\n","### Why is NLP a \"hard\" problem? \n","\n","Language is inherently ambiguous. Once person's interpretation of a sentence may very well differ from another person's interpretation. Because of this inability to consistently be clear, it's hard to have an NLP technique that works perfectly. \n","\n","### Glossary\n","\n","Here is some common terminology that we'll encounter throughout the workshop:\n","\n","<b>Corpus: </b> (Plural: Corpora) a collection of written texts that serve as our datasets.\n","\n","<b>nltk: </b> (Natural Language Toolkit) the python module we'll be using repeatedly; it has a lot of useful built-in NLP techniques.\n","\n","<b>Token: </b> a string of contiguous characters between two spaces, or between a space and punctuation marks.
