/*Farmer John has built a new long barn with N stalls. Given an array of integers 
* A of size N where each element of the array represents the location of the stall 
* and an integer B which represents the number of cows.
* His cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once 
* put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, John wants to assign the cows 
* to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. 
* What is the largest minimum distance?
* A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
* B = 3
* Ans 2
